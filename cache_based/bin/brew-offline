~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You're using \`brew' in offline mode.

Some pointers:

1. Do not try to install anything but stable specs
2. Run every command through \`brew offline', e.g.
    \`brew offline install gcc'
3. Do not try to do anything funky with Homebrew's
caches or prefixes.
